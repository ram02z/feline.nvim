A minimal, stylish and customizable statusline for Neovim written in Lua

Requires Neovim >= 0.5

ABOUT                                                           *feline-about*

Feline is a lua statusline inspired by galaxyline
<https://github.com/glepnir/galaxyline.nvim>, but being more minimal and
keeping complete customizability in mind. Feline is less of a statusline unto
itself but more of a framework for you to easily build your own statusline on,
while being able to tweak every tiny bit to your heart’s content. But for
those who just want to get stuff done, Feline also provides a default
statusline which should fit the needs of most people.

FEATURES                                                     *feline-features*


- Ease-of-use.
- Complete customizability over every component.
- Built-in providers for things like vi-mode, file info, file size, cursor position, diagnostics (using |Neovim’s buiilt-in LSP|), git branch and diffs (using gitsigns.nvim <https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim/>), etc.
- Minimalistic, only provides the bare minimum and allows the user to build their own components very easily.
